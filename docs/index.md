Author new reports locally in VS Code (Markdown or `.ipynb`), commit, and your site updates automatically.

- Uniform layout + CSS
- Search across reports
- Tags and tag indexes
- One-click **downloads (CSV/XLSX/PNG/SVG)** for figures and tables
- Easy **embeds** via `<iframe>` snippets

ðŸ‘‰ Start with the **[Developer Guide](guides/developer-guide.md)** or see a **[sample report](reports/sample-report.md)**.
